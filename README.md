# mouse_mover


Simply `mvn clean package` from the root directory, and then run the `java -jar ./target/mouse_mover-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`. This will then move your mouse horizontally. The exit criteria is when you move your mouse vertically. For Windows users, after ensuring java is installed, copy the jar file to the desktop and create a `run.bat` file with the following text `java -jar mouse_mover-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
